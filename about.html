              <h1>About Design Your Life!</h1>
               <p>The Design Your Life app helps you figure out which activities bring you enjoyment, energy, and engagement. 
               These clues are the first step you need to take to design your ideal life.</p>
            
              <p> Activity logs record daily your main activities, and a gauge to show how engaged and energized you were. 
              Reflection logs are done once a week to record your trends, insights and surprises as to what activities work and don't work for you.

              <h2>Enjoyment</h2>
              <p>Enjoyment is "the state or process of taking pleasure in something." By participating in Design Your Life, you will
                be able to not only keep track of the activities and events that give you pleasure, but you'll also be able 
                to determine which events are robbing from enjoyment. This will give you the opportunity to take stock in your life today 
                and see where you need to make changes, where you need to refocus, and how to set yourself on a path that will
                ensure you're finding enjoyment in all you do.

                <h2>Energized</h2>
                <p>It's time to get energized. To find passion in what you do. To be motivated for change and create the life you've always wanted. 
                  We've all heard "fatigue begets fatigue." The same is true about energy, movement, and motivation. 
                  When you discover the actions that give you a renewed energy, you will desire to continue on that path.
                  With Design Your Life, you will find a new strength and new direction for life that gives you an energy like never before.

          <h2>Engaged</h2>
                 <p>Life was never intended to be a spectator sport. Once you've discovered your true passions and the aspects of life that 
                   give you enjoyment and renewed energy, it's time to engage others. To become part of something that will help you 
                   create a mark on this world and leave a legacy. The greatest legacy is a life well lived. A life of no regrets. A life enjoyed.
